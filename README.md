# Automatic-Railway-Gate-Control-System
The automatic railway gate control system project was developed during my final year at Cooch Behar Government Engineering College in 2024. The primary goal of this project was to enhance railway safety by automating the operation of railway gates based on real-time train detection using Image Processing and Python.
